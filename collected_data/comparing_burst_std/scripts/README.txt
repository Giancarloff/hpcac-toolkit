The scripts are the same, the only difference is that the ARM version executes a make clean before compiling to make sure all benchmark and auxiliary binaries are compiled for the correct architecture. If you are running
a fresh download of the NPB3.4.2 benchmarks, that should not make a difference and running either script will produce the same result.

To run them, they must be within the same folder as the NPB3.4.2.tar.gz file. Also make sure the scripts have executive permissions.
